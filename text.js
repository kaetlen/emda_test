He’s going to crush you.","General Gob scampers way, fading into the trees of the Blackroot Forest.","ARCHER: Don’t let him get away-","KNIGHT: It’s fine- he won’t get far in there anyway. We’ll catch up soon enough.","MAGE: Well, let’s hop to it then, slow pokes!"]

Tell us who sent you.","GENERAL GOB: I owe you nothing!","The Knight slowly lifts his hammer above General Gob’s head.","GENERAL GOB: Okay fine! The Lich king. He’s been dead for thousands of years- but some necromancers ressurrected him. He made us an offer we couldn’t refuse. But we have that reward now- let me keep my head!","MAGE: And where can we find this Lich king?","GENERAL GOB: At the very end of the Blackroot Forest— as you get closer you will see the ruins of an old castle. This is where you will find his lair. ","NARRATOR: The Knight steps back, and The Rogue smirks, letting General Gob scamper back into the trees. They begin their trek towards his lair. ","LICH: Well, well, well. What do we have here?","KNIGHT: You have been hurting Innocent people.","LICH: Hahaha! A being as powerful as I deserves to do whatever I want with your kind. You can’t stop me.","ROGUE: We’ll see about that."]
